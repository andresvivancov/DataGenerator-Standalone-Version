Smart Meter Data Generator
======================
This data generator is a framework that could generate the data for different analytic purpose. The kernel of this data generator is the generator factory, which is responsible for creating the generator that satisfies a specific data model. This generator currently supports generating the following data sets:

1. Simple linear regression data
2. Multiple linear regression data
3. Clustering data
4. Smart meter data (satisfying 3-line model with seeded data)
